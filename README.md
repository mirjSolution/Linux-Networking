## 1. Local Area Network (LAN)

- A LAN connects multiple devices (e.g., phones, computers, printers) within a physical location.
- Each device is uniquely identified using an **IP address**.

---

## 2. IP Address and Subnet

- IP address: 32-bit value represented in four octets (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
- Subnet mask determines which portion of the IP is the **network** and which is the **host**.
- Example:
  - Subnet: `255.255.255.0` (24 fixed bits)
  - IP Range: `192.168.0.1` to `192.168.0.255`
- CIDR notation: `192.168.0.0/24`

---

## 3. Switches and Routers

- **Switch:** Forwards traffic within LAN based on IP addresses.
- **Router:** Connects LAN to WAN (Internet) and performs **Network Address Translation (NAT)**.

---

## 4. Gateway and NAT

- **Gateway:** Router‚Äôs IP in the LAN, used to access external networks.
- **NAT:** Translates internal LAN IP to external public IP (used for Internet communication).

---

## 5. Firewall and Ports

- **Firewall:** Set of rules that control inbound/outbound traffic.
- **Ports:** Logical access points on a device for network services.
  - Port 80 ‚Üí HTTP
  - Port 443 ‚Üí HTTPS
  - Port 3306 ‚Üí MySQL
  - Port 5432 ‚Üí PostgreSQL

---

## 6. DNS (Domain Name System)

- Resolves human-readable names (e.g., `facebook.com`) to IP addresses.
- Structure: Root ‚Üí TLD (.com, .org, .edu) ‚Üí Domain name (devops.com) ‚Üí Subdomain (tutorial.devops.com)
- Managed by ICANN.
- Common TLDs:
  - `.com`, `.org`, `.edu`, `.gov`, `.mil`, `.net`
  - Country code TLDs: `.uk`, `.us`, `.de`, etc.
- DNS resolution translates human-readable domain names (like https://www.google.com/search?q=google.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 172.217.160.142). This process allows your computer to locate and connect to the correct server on the internet.

## 7. Useful Networking Commands

| Command    | Description                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `ifconfig` | Shows network interfaces and IP addresses |
| `netstat`  | Lists active ports and connections        |
| `ps aux`   | Lists running processes                   |
| `nslookup` | Queries DNS for domain to IP (or reverse) |
| `ping`     | Checks connectivity to an IP or domain    |

## Summary

As a DevOps engineer, understanding:

- IP addressing and subnetting
- DNS resolution
- Firewall/port configuration
- Basic network tools

...is essential to configure and troubleshoot Linux servers effectively.
